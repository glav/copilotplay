Based on the revised constraints—specifically the team of 6 senior engineers plus a dedicated security expert, the reduced scope of 1-2 DevOps actions, and the holiday break—this plan is **achievable**.

The plan utilizes the high seniority of the team to accelerate the core platform build in the first three sprints, allows for a complete break during the holidays, and uses the final block of sprints for complex integration, UI, and hardening.

### Sprint Plan: GenAI Azure DevOps Provisioning Platform

| Sprint | Dates | Type | Narrative | Goals / Focus / Deliverables |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | **26 Nov - 28 Nov** | **Prep** | Establish the team foundation and technical constraints to enable rapid development. | • Finalize remaining ADRs (Web framework, Secrets management).<br>• Backlog grooming and story refinement for Sprints 1-2.<br>• Development environment, Repo, and Azure subscriptions provisioned.<br>• **Security:** Initial threat modeling session and safety evaluation framework definition. |
| **1** | **01 Dec - 05 Dec** | **Execution** | Lay the core infrastructure tracks and prove we can talk to Azure OpenAI. | • **Phase 1 Core:** Database schema designed and deployed; Runtime engine skeleton created.<br>• **Phase 1 Core:** Capability discovery system implemented.<br>• **Phase 3 Integration:** REST API skeleton established.<br>• **Security:** Agentic IAM requirements defined; Initial threat vector analysis started.<br>• **Tech Spike:** Azure OpenAI connectivity and basic prompt engineering tests. |
| **2** | **08 Dec - 12 Dec** | **Execution** | Connect the brain to the hands: Get the LLM to successfully execute its first real-world action. | • **Phase 2 Automation:** Implement 1st Azure DevOps action (e.g., Environment Provisioning) with basic auth.<br>• **Phase 1 Core:** Channel adapter pattern implemented.<br>• **Phase 4 LLM:** Basic Function Calling implementation to invoke the 1st action.<br>• **Security:** Draft Agentic IAM architecture; Security evaluation pipeline V1 setup.<br>• **Testing:** Unit testing framework set up. |
| **3** | **15 Dec - 19 Dec** | **Execution** | Deepen the intelligence with memory and identity while expanding automation capabilities. | • **Phase 2 Automation:** Implement 2nd Azure DevOps action (e.g., Pipeline Provisioning).<br>• **Phase 4 LLM:** Parameter extraction logic (LLM extracts user values).<br>• **Phase 4 LLM:** Conversation memory (Redis/Cosmos) integration.<br>• **Security:** Agentic IAM implementation V1 (Identity propagation).<br>• **Demo:** Console-based end-to-end flow (User -> LLM -> Action). |
| **4** | **22 Dec - 26 Dec** | **Holiday** | Recharge and rest. | • *Reduced Capacity / Holiday Break*<br>• No critical deliverables scheduled. |
| **5** | **29 Dec - 02 Jan** | **Holiday** | Recharge and rest. | • *Reduced Capacity / Holiday Break*<br>• No critical deliverables scheduled. |
| **6** | **05 Jan - 09 Jan** | **Execution** | Give the platform a face and ensure it's safe to use. | • **Phase 3 Integration:** Web UI implementation (Chat interface).<br>• **Phase 4 LLM:** Advanced parameter validation (LLM asks follow-up questions for missing data).<br>• **Phase 3 Integration:** Real-time progress tracking (SignalR/WebSockets).<br>• **Security:** Safety evaluations executed against current agents; Red team findings documented. |
| **7** | **12 Jan - 16 Jan** | **Execution** | Connect all the pieces into a seamless, secure, and robust end-to-end experience. | • **Phase 2 Automation:** Error handling and retry logic for actions.<br>• **Phase 3 Integration:** Full end-to-end integration (Web UI -> API -> LLM -> Capability).<br>• **Testing:** Integration tests written; Test coverage >60%.<br>• **Security:** Agentic Threat vector mitigations implemented.<br>• **Refinement:** Prompt tuning for edge cases. |
| **8** | **19 Jan - 23 Jan** | **Execution** | Polish the surface and document the depths for a production-ready handover. | • **Polish:** Performance optimization and load testing.<br>• **Testing:** Test coverage >80% achieved.<br>• **Documentation:** Code documentation, API specs, and User Guide.<br>• **Security:** Final Security & Safety Evaluation Report complete.<br>• **Architecture:** Final Reference Architecture documentation. |
| **9** | **26 Jan - 30 Jan** | **Handoff** | Pass the torch to the Rio team with confidence and clarity. | • Knowledge transfer sessions with Rio team.<br>• Deployment guide verification.<br>• Final repository cleanup and handover.<br>• Contingency buffer for any critical last-minute fixes. |
